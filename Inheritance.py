# Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from some another class.
# The benefits of inheritance are:
#
#  *   It represents real-world relationships well.
#  *  It provides reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also,
#     it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
#  *   It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A,
#     then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
